# predictor

I have modified my AEternity Project. From the tutorial I learnt I was able to build a Program called Predictor. What it does with Blockchain is that 1. The user will register with his or her phone number and name. This will be stored in the Blockchain using the Smart contract written for the program. 2. The Next is that the user will have four options of range of number to pick, I other for them to predict the random number that the system will generate. the range and their price tag are given below 1. Range: 1 - 10 price: 20 AE 2. Range: 1 - 20 price 15 AE 3. Range: 1 - 50 price 10 AE 4. Range: 1 - 100 price 5 AE The user will have to pay the above AEternity token in other to have access to make the prediction and get some point. The pricing for 1 - 10 is higher because the user have higher chance of predicting correctly the right number
